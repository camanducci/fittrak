What
====

A no-frills fitness tracking tool for the stats nerd.

Why
===

Tired of using various fitness tracking apps (mostly fitocracy).

Ideas
=====

Rough notes on some things to keep in mind:

- UI/UX
    - Should be mobile and offline first
    - The main usecase will be in a gym setting
        - Quick to load / update workout
        - Consider poor connection

- Workouts
    - Save as routine
    - Start new workout from template or custom
    - Recommend exercises based on previous workouts or most popular
    - Add exercise, auto complete

- Stats/Progress
    - How much I've lifted, how close I am to my max, volume differences, etc.
    - Could even incorporate strength standards type metric (exrx)
    - Can track based on time as well

- Don't be a social network

- Share workouts externally
