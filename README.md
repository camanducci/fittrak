WHY
===

Tired of using various fitness tracking apps (mostly fitocracy).

Here are some of the things I think should be solved in the ideal tracking app:

- UI is confusing
    - Should be mobile and offline first
- No exercise 'templates'
    - Fitocracy has custom workouts but you need to pay to build one
    - Would be nice if this learned patterns overtime and could suggest
- Does not let you put in custom exercises and existing selection is confusing and incomplete
    - This could be due to naming as well, for example 'calf raise' can be done various ways, should it matter how one defines the exercise?
    - Could allow user entry and keep (most popular results + previously used) in autocomplete
- Tries to be a social network when all I want is a personal training app
    - Unneccessary cruft which makes loading slow and therefore too long to get to what I want to do, track my workout
    - The gamification aspect of it is nice at first there is some incentive to continue working out but it quickly becomes pointless
        - At first there are acheivements, for example deadlift body weight, but veterans who have been using the app for years are now just grinding for levels
- Would like better stats
    - How much I've lifted, how close I am to my max, volume differences, etc.
    - Could even incorporate strength standards type metric (exrx)
- Want it specifically tailored to resistance weight training not cardio
- I should be able to share my workouts with the public
